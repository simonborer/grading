Check your data - are there any rows where the firstname has a 't', but the lastname does not?","Q4: You'll want to use the SUBSTR function to include a column that lists the third letter of the last name. For the WHERE clause, remember that for every condition you need to restate the column name, so for this we would write WHERE firstname LIKE '%t%' OR lastname LIKE '%t%'","Q4: the LIKE clause is case insensitive, so you don't need to check for both 't', and 'T', but regardless, you can't chain together clauses this way - you need to test one column against one clause, and then chain these pairings together with AND or OR, so instead of `firstname OR lastname LIKE '%t%' OR '%T%'`, you'd need to write `firstname LIKE '%t%' OR firstname LIKE '%T% OR lastname LIKE '%t%' OR lastname LIKE '%T%'","Q5: Strange that your assignment has a question mark (?) instead of a \xf6 (an o with an \xfclaut).

I think you need to decide how you're going to approach verifying your results. ",'Q6: Be careful! A space is not the same thing as an empty string. Also, just as in question 4, for the WHERE clause, remember that for every condition you need to restate the column name, so this needs to be "WHERE state IS NULL OR fax IS NULL;". However, the question should not be answered with this clause. You are to get ALL the results from the customer table. COALESCE will replace null values, but only if they are null.',"Q6: Unfortunately COALESCE doesn't accept a list of columns, so you have to write the function for each column that you want to affect, like so: \"SELECT customerID, COALESCE(state, ''), COALESCE(fax, '')\"","Q6: The COALESCE function only accepts two parameters - the input data and the output. NULL is implied. Also, be careful - whitespace is not the same as an empty string.","Q7: Take a look at the SUBSTR function and the > operator - these are what your answer is missing.","Q7: The SUBSTR function starts counting characters at the value '1', so your function is only selecting 19 characters. For your WHERE clause, I believe you meant to use the LENGTH function to get the total number of characters in the title.","Q7: You need to use the substring function in your list of selected columns to return the truncated title. Also, the extra functions (upper and substr) in your where clause don't do anything because they're not being compared to anything.","Q8: This works, but repetition not only means extra work, both now and when maintaining the code, but also more opportunities for mistakes. To make your code more concise, you could use parentheses, and write your clause as \"WHERE (billingCity = 'Berlin' OR billingCity = 'Toronto') AND total > 5\", or simply use a list: \"WHERE billingCity IN ('Berlin', 'Toronto') AND total > 5\".","Q8: You were very close! Rather than using the LIKE operator (which matches a pattern), you could've used IN (which checks against a list), or the \"equals\" operator (and appropriate parentheses), like this: \"WHERE (billingCity = 'Berlin' OR billingCity = 'Toronto') AND total > 5\"","Q8: Your query selects all the invoices from Berlin, regardless of the value in the total column.

So, for the keyword 'secretcode', the cipher would look like this: a    b    c    d    e    f    g    h    i    j    k    l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s    t    u    v    w    x    y    z s    e    c    r    t    o    d    a    b    f    g    h    i    j    k    l    m    n    p    q    u    v    w    z    y    z So if you were to encrypt the phrase \"the eagle flies at midnight\" with this cipher, it would read \"qat tsdht ohbtq sq ibrjbdaq\".
